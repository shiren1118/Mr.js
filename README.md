# Introduction

I collect what I have done with javascript to make it a library called Mr.js. It is a library like jQuery to interact with DOM using javascript. you will find some names of api is the same as jQuery, so user can easily use my library to replace jQuery even it's not so better than the other.

However, Mr.js also have some advantages if you use it, such as Iterator, Deferred and so on. I believe it will be a useful tool.

This is just Mr.js alpha version apis. Because some apis will probably be updated some day. And it have to be tested strictly.
